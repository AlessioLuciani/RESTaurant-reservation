\section{Solution implementation}
Here we discuss the implementation of our solution. As already anticipated,
the core of the system is a microservice architecture that communicates
through the REST API. Since every microservice is independent of each
other, the technologies that are used internally in the various modules
do not have to be the same ones. So, apart from keeping a standardized REST
interface among the components, we could develop the microservices with
different programming languages and frameworks. Here are described the
specific implementations of the single services.

\subsubsection{Microservices}


\subsubsection{User auth}

This module was built using Typescript that runs on a Node.js environment after
being compiled into Javascript. The corresponding database was built using MongoDB
that provides a NoSQL structure. The module uses the Express.js library to expose
its REST API and the Mongoose library to communicate with the database. The POST http
method was used to perform operations that edit entries in the database, such as
during the registration. The GET http method, instead, was used for operations that
do not modify content in the database, but only read information, such as the token
validation.\\

Here is shown the exposed API:\\

%\emph{http://user_auth_api:3000/[query]}\\


POST register\\
JSON body data: name: string, surname: string, email: string, password: string\\
JSON response: token: string OR error: string\\

POST login\\
JSON body data: email: string, password: string OR token: string\\
JSON response: token: string OR error: string\\

POST logout\\
JSON body data: email: string, token: nullable string\\
JSON response: empty OR error: string\\

GET validate\\
JSON body data: email: string, token: string\\
JSON response: token: string OR error: string\\


\subsubsection{Restaurant auth}

This module was implemented very similarly to the user auth one.\\

Here is shown the exposed API:\\

%\emph{http://restaurant_auth_api:3000/[query]}\\


POST register\\
JSON body data: name: string, email: string, password: string\\
JSON response: token: string OR error: string\\

POST login\\
JSON body data: email: string, password: string OR token: string\\
JSON response: token: string OR error: string\\

POST logout\\
JSON body data: email: string, token: nullable string\\
JSON response: empty OR error: string\\

GET validate\\
JSON body data: email: string, token: string\\
JSON response: token: string OR error: string\\
