\section{Problem introduction}
While there are lots of services to order food deliveries,
there is seemingly little choice in the market when it comes
to restaurant booking services. The most widespread option to
book a restaurant is to use the restaurant’s website. This
makes it hard to integrate the different “processes” of going to 
the restaurant, namely searching for where to go, reading the place 
information (e.g. the menù) and finally booking a table. As things are
now one would use Google / Tripadvisor for the search part and 
restaurants own websites/phone numbers for the booking part.
Getting information about the menu is seldom a feature offered by
the aforementioned service providers and an actual pain-point for users. 
Our web app conveys all the different steps into a single, easy-to-use
platform where users can search, read the menù and book a restaurant.
Additionally, restaurant owners are able to create their own business
profile and manage them: updating the menù when needed and accepting the
reservations made by users. This last point is particularly important,
since restaurants may still receive bookings from different means
(phone calls, customers unexpectedly showing up, etc.)
